Testing GitHub for CS50 submits

Hi People,

In this file i'm not going to talk about myself just because Hubot is making me. Instead i'll talk about our cat "Jack". He's very young and playful, which can make working on a project difficult. So instead of putting him in a small room, we should buy a toy that is soft and quiet.
